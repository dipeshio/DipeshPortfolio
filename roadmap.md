## Pixel Art Portfolio Website - AI Generation Roadmap

**Project Goal:** Generate an open-source pixel art portfolio website.

**AI Model:**  (Specify your preferred AI model here, e.g., Gemini Advanced)

**Stage 1: Core Structure and Styling**

1. **Prompt:** "Generate the HTML structure for a basic one-page website with sections for 'About Me,' 'Projects,' 'Contact,' and a footer. Use semantic HTML5 tags."
2. **Prompt:** "Create a CSS file that styles the website with a pixel art theme. Include pixelated fonts, a limited color palette (e.g., 8-bit), and large, chunky buttons."
3. **Prompt:** "Design a simple pixel art logo for the website. The logo should be [Your Name or Initials] and have a transparent background."

**Stage 2: Content Generation**

1. **Prompt:** "Write a short 'About Me' section in HTML. The text should be a humorous and engaging introduction in the third person, highlighting my skills as a developer and my passion for pixel art."
2. **Prompt:** "Generate HTML and CSS for three featured project cards. Each card should have a pixel art thumbnail, a title, a short description, and links to the live site and GitHub repository. Use placeholder images and links for now."
3. **Prompt:** "Create a 'Contact' section with a pixel art-styled form that includes fields for name, email, and message. Ensure the form is non-functional for now."

**Stage 3: Interactive Elements**

1. **Prompt:** "Add a simple JavaScript animation to the website, such as a bouncing pixel art character or a scrolling background."
2. **Prompt:** "Make the 'Projects' section interactive. When a user clicks on a project card, display a modal window with a larger image, a detailed description, and links to the project."

**Stage 4: Optimization and Refinement**

1. **Prompt:** "Optimize the website's CSS and JavaScript for performance. Minify the files and reduce the number of HTTP requests."
2. **Prompt:** "Review the website's accessibility. Ensure it meets WCAG standards for color contrast, keyboard navigation, and screen reader compatibility."

**Stage 5: Deployment and Open Sourcing**

1. **Prompt:** "Provide instructions on how to deploy this website to GitHub Pages."
2. **Prompt:** "Generate a README.md file for the GitHub repository. The README should include a project description, a screenshot of the website, instructions on how to contribute, and a license (e.g., MIT License)."

**Additional Notes:**

* Throughout the process, ensure the AI generates clean, well-commented code.
* Regularly review and refine the AI's output to ensure it meets your expectations and follows best practices.
* Replace placeholder content with your actual information and project details.
* Consider using AI image generation tools to create unique pixel art assets for the website.

This roadmap provides a structured approach to generating your pixel art portfolio website with AI. Remember to adapt the prompts and stages to your specific needs and preferences. Good luck!
